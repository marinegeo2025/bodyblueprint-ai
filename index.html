        Driven by science. Powered by AI. Built to optimize your aesthetic
        health.

          >本来の面目 "Honrai no Menmoku" is a Zen Buddhist phrase meaning "your
          original face"—the true self before the world shaped you.</i
        >
      </p>

      We each begin this life in perfect wholeness—our original face, pure and
      unclouded by the world. Over time, distractions and doubts obscure our
      natural brilliance. Yet deep within, that radiant potential remains.
      <p>
        本来の面目 (Honrai no Menmoku) calls us back to our true selves. Guided
        by AI and shaped by science, this app is a companion on your
        path—helping you nourish body and mind in harmony. With the
        compassionate blessing of Kannon‐san, Bodhisattva of Mercy, you step
        forward. Empowered to uncover the shining truth you have always carried,
        you realize that the journey is simply returning home to the perfection
        that was there from the start.
      </p>
